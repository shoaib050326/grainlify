//! # Grainlify Contract Upgrade System
//!
//! Secure contract upgrade pattern with admin-controlled WASM updates,
//! version tracking, migration replay protection, and multisig governance.
//!
//! ## Security Model
//! - Admin address is immutable after initialization
//! - All upgrades require multisig threshold OR single admin authorization
//! - Migrations are replay-protected via pre-committed hashes
//! - Timelock enforces review window before upgrade execution
//! - Read-only mode blocks all mutations during incidents
