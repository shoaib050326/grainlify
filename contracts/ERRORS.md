# Unified Error Registry

This document defines the centralized error code space for all Grainlify smart contracts. By maintaining a unified registry, we ensure that error codes are consistent, non-overlapping across different contracts, and easily mapped to human-readable messages in the SDK and backend.

## Registry Ranges

To prevent collisions between different functional modules, error codes are assigned within specific ranges:

| Range | Module / Kind | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 - 99 | **Common** | General purpose errors used by all contracts (Initialisation, Auth, State, etc.) |
| 100 - 199 | **Governance** | Errors related to voting, proposals, and thresholds. |
| 200 - 299 | **Escrow** | Errors related to fund locking, bounty management, and payouts. |
| 300 - 399 | **Identity / KYC** | Errors related to claims, signatures, and transaction limits. |
| 400 - 499 | **Program Escrow** | Specific errors for batch program initialisation and management. |
| 1000+ | **External** | Errors from third-party integrations or circuit breakers. |

## Canonical Error Codes

## Adding New Errors

1.  **Select Range**: Identify the most relevant module for your error.
2.  **Assign Code**: Use the next available integer in that range.
3.  **Update `contracts/grainlify-core/src/errors.rs`**: Add the new variant to the `Error` enum.
4.  **Update Backend**: Add the mapping to `backend/internal/errors/contract_errors.go`.
5.  **Update SDK**: Add the variant to `ContractErrorCode` and its numeric mapping in `contracts/sdk/src/errors.ts`.
6.  **Document**: Update this table with the new code and description.

## Implementation Details

### Rust (On-Chain)
Contracts should use `#[contracterror]` and re-export the unified error type:
```rust
pub use grainlify_core::errors::Error as ContractError;
```

### Go (Backend)
All codes are stored in a single unified map:
```go
var unifiedErrors = map[uint32]contractErrorEntry{
    // ... entries ...
}
```

### TypeScript (SDK)
The SDK uses a unified enum and a global numeric lookup map:
```typescript
export enum ContractErrorCode {
  BOUNTY_EXISTS = 'BOUNTY_EXISTS',
  // ...
}

export const UNIFIED_ERROR_MAP: Record<number, ContractErrorCode> = {
  201: ContractErrorCode.BOUNTY_EXISTS,
  // ...
}
```
